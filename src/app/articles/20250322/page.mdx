this was such a sad movie

i might have just watched one of a very populated genre of movie in Japan, but in America we don't get movies like these very often.

the protagonists are relatable and strongly individual. they don't let themselves sacrifice who they are. they're not pushovers and i like that because i hate pushovers
never seen a more realistic depiction of a healthy relationship having to end because the two are just in different life stages. 

this movie made me want to never lose who i am in service of some asshole boss or some stupid job or some insane friend. i'm me and i like what i like and nothing will ever change that. 
mugi and kinu loved each other because they each were passionate about the same things. in the end, it was mugi's inability to just be himself and let go of everyone else's opinion, 
whether it be his dad, kinu's mom, or his friends', and to just listen to kinu, that was their downfall.

life only gets more difficult if you believe it will. if you don't believe it will, and only focus on what you enjoy, you will never have to face that terrible
filter that strains out your youth and makes you into third-act mugi. 

relationships aren't always perfect, and they also aren't always super romantic.

this movie tackles these themes through its own unique, sobering, and youthful lens.

it spoke to me because i also never want to let go of what makes me unique, what keeps me youthful and undeterred. kinu never loses her spirit, and neither does the camera.
the lack of music feels like a walk in a cold morning in tokyo. it makes it special. the sound of wind.

i'm going to print this poster and hang it in my room as a reminder - a reminder never to lose what makes me youthful or makes my vision wondrous.
i don't have to ever lose what makes me, me.
