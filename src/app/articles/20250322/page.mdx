this was such a sad movie

i might have just watched one of a very populated genre of movie in Japan, but in America we don&apos;t get movies like these very often.

the protagonists are relatable and strongly individual. they don&apos;t let themselves sacrifice who they are. they&apos;re not pushovers and i like that because i hate pushovers

this movie made me want to never lose who i am in service of some asshole boss or some stupid job or some insane friend. i&apos;m me and i like what i like and nothing will ever change that. and if i can finally find someone who feels the same way about stuff i like, we can be like the first half of this movie.

never seen a more realistic depiction of a healthy relationship having to end because the two are just in different life stages. insanely rewatchable..

i&apos;m going to print this poster and hang it in my room as a reminder.
