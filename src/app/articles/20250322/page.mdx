this was such a sad movie

i might have just watched one of a very populated genre of movie in Japan, but in America we don't get movies like these very often.

the protagonists are relatable and strongly individual. they don't let themselves sacrifice who they are. they're not pushovers and i like that because i hate pushovers

this movie made me want to never lose who i am in service of some asshole boss or some stupid job or some insane friend. i'm me and i like what i like and nothing will ever change that. and if i can finally find someone who feels the same way about stuff i like, we can be like the first half of this movie.

never seen a more realistic depiction of a healthy relationship having to end because the two are just in different life stages. insanely rewatchable..

i'm going to print this poster and hang it in my room as a reminder.
